# Objectives

### QA

1. Write a docker-compose.yml file that wraps an application inside an nginx reverse-proxy (Any sample application can be used). List the docker commands you would use to start this container, and to inspect the running process.

You can choose between tasks 2 and 3

2. Write an AWS lambda function that can be called via a URL. When given a name, the function should return: "Hello, " You only need to provide the code of the function, but if you also want to list the steps that need to be taken in the AWS UI, you can include that as well.

3. Write a github actions workflow file that on pull requests, runs a couple of sample commands on an Ubuntu runner. The commands can be anything simple like 'echo "Test"', etc. 



### RE

1. From the Maven directory, describe what the `pom.xml` file is for, where the resulting artifacts would be uploaded to, and what the Java code located in `src` will do when compiled and ran.
2. What is a `.gitignore` file and why would you want one?
